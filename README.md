# developer_challenge
Coding a well-structured, user-friendly UI for scale, with  minimal help from UI libraries/frameworks

# Getting started
<code>npm i</code>
<code>npm run dev</code>

# The Process
The layout was created on a single HTML page using semantic HTML. Styling was done using SCSS. I used node-sass (npm package) to complie SCSS to CSS.

I created wire-frames to plan the layout and figure out the elements I would need.
